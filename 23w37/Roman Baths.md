A temple was constructed in the years 60 and 70 (AD) in the first decades of Roman Britain. The baths were designed for public bathing and were used until 5th century. According to the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle*, the baths were in ruins in the 6th century.

The Roman Baths are splitted into four main pieces: the Scared Springs, the Roman Temple, the Roman Bath House, and a museum located next to the complex, that contains many Romans artefacts. 

# Hot spring

The water is sourced from rainfall on the nerby hill, which is then filtered through limestone. Geothermal energy raises the water temperature to between 69 and 96 Â°C. Under preasure, the heated water bubbles up from the hroung into the baths. The thermal water contains sodium, calcium, chloride and sulphate ions in high concentrations. The Roman Baths are no longer used for bathing.
